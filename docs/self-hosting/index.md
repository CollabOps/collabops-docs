# Self-Hosting CollabOps

Take full control of your CollabOps deployment by hosting it on your own infrastructure. Our self-hosting options provide enterprise-grade security, customization, and compliance capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure:

### üê≥ Docker (Recommended for Getting Started)
Perfect for development, testing, and single-server deployments.

- **Quick setup** with Docker Compose
- **Minimal resources** required
- **Easy updates** and maintenance
- **Development-friendly** configuration

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes with Helm
Enterprise-ready, scalable deployment for production environments.

- **[Helm Chart Guide](/docs/self-hosting/helm)** - Complete Kubernetes deployment
- **High availability** with auto-scaling
- **Production-grade** monitoring and logging
- **Zero-downtime updates** with rolling deployments

### üñ•Ô∏è Bare Metal / VM
Traditional server deployment for maximum control.

- **Direct system installation**
- **Custom configurations**
- **Legacy system integration**
- **Maximum performance**

## üìã System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+, or equivalent)

### Recommended for Production
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 50GB+ SSD with backup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+ (external)
- **Cache**: Redis 6+ (external)
- **Load Balancer**: NGINX or HAProxy

## üîß Core Components

CollabOps consists of several interconnected services:

### Application Services
- **Web Server** - React-based frontend
- **API Server** - Node.js backend services
- **WebSocket Server** - Real-time communication
- **File Storage** - Document and media handling

### Data Services
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and session storage
- **Elasticsearch** - Search and analytics (optional)

### Supporting Services

cd self-hosting

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit configuration

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### 2. Kubernetes with Helm (15 minutes)

```bash
# Add Helm repository
helm repo add collabops https://charts.collabops.ai
helm repo update

# Install with default values
helm install collabops collabops/collabops \
  --namespace collabops \
  --create-namespace
```

See our **[detailed Helm guide](/docs/self-hosting/helm)** for production configuration.
